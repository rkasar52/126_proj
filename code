Pairs Plot
```{r}
pairs(Price~Sq_feet+Beds+AC)

##Seems to be positive correlation between square feet and price. No correlation between beds and price. AC seems to be a good predictor as well. 
```

```{r}
pairs(Price~Garage+Pool+Year+Quality)
##Garage and Quality seem like good linear predictors. Year needs to be transformed. Pool seems ot have negative relationship
```

```{r}
pairs(Price~Style+Lot+Highway)
##Style is not a good predictor. Highway is a good predictor. Lot size is a good preidctor, probably needs to be transformed. 
```

```{r}
##fit price to square feet 

fit=lm(Price~Sq_feet)

plot(Sq_feet, Price ,xlab = 'Sq_feet', ylab = 'Price', main = 'Price vs Sq_Feet')
abline(fit)
s=summary(fit)
s

```

Hypothesis Test to see if there is a relationship between Price and Sq_feet
H0: B1=0=B3...B12=0    Ha: At least one of the Betas is not equal to 0. 
Pvalue is less than .05 so we can reject the null hypothesis that B1=0. 



```{r}


mod.reduced = lm(Price ~ 1)
mod.full = lm(Price ~Sq_feet + Beds + Baths + AC + Garage + Pool + 
    Year + Quality + Style + Lot + Highway)
anova(mod.reduced, mod.full)

```
Pvalue is very close to 0 so we know that there is atleast one useful predictor.



Do AIC test to see which predictors are useful in the model. 
```{r}
step(mod.reduced, scope = list(lower = mod.reduced, upper = mod.full))




```
AIC test shows that SQ_feet, quality, style, year, lot, garage, beds, highway, and AC, are the best predictors for our model.


```{r}


mod.AIC = lm(formula = Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot )
s=summary(mod.AIC)
s

```
All Beta values are significant except for Highway and AC as their pval are large.
Conduct BIC test to see if similar results

```{r}
betas = s$coefficients
#black line
yhatq1=100+betas[2]*Sq_feet[Quality==1]
#red line
yhatq2=100+betas[2]*Sq_feet[Quality==2]+betas[3]
#green line
yhatq3=100+betas[2]*Sq_feet[Quality==3]+betas[4]
plot(Sq_feet,Price,xlab='sqfeet',ylab='price',main='graph with quality')
points(Sq_feet[Quality==2],Price[Quality==2],col = 2)
points(Sq_feet[Quality==3],Price[Quality==3],col = 3)

lines(Sq_feet[Quality==1],yhatq1,col=1)
lines(Sq_feet[Quality==2],yhatq2,col=2)
lines(Sq_feet[Quality==3],yhatq3,col=3)

legend('topleft', bty='n',pch=20,col=c(1,2,3),c('quality1','quality2','quality3'),lty = c(1,1,1))
```

```{r}
pricefit = lm(Price~Sq_feet)
summary(pricefit)
```


```{r}
n = nrow(dat)
step(mod.reduced, scope = list(lower = mod.reduced, upper = mod.full), k = log(n))



```
BIC results were widely different that the AIC tests as it only includes Sq_feet, Quality, Style, Year and Lot. 

```{r}
mod.BIC = lm(formula = Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot)
summary(mod.BIC)

```
All these predictors are statistically significant


Pairs plot to check for interaction
```{r}
pairs(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot)

```
Pairs plot shows that there seems to be some interaction between Quality and Sq_feet and Year and Sq_feet.


Hypothesis test to see if we should add interaction terms. 
```{r}
mod.reduced=lm(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot)
mod.full=lm(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot + Sq_feet*Quality+Sq_feet*Lot+Style*Year)

anova1 <- anova(mod.reduced,mod.full)
anova1

step(mod.reduced, scope = list(lower = mod.reduced, upper = mod.full), k = log(n))
```

BIC test shows that we need to add Interaction term between Sq_feet and quality and Style and Year. 

```{r}
##find adjusted r^2 to see which interaction term is better.
model=lm(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot + 
    Sq_feet:Quality)
s=summary(model)
s$adj.r.squared
model.1=model=lm(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot + 
    Style:Year)
s=summary(model.1)
s$adj.r.squared

```
Adjusted r^2 shows that interaction term between Sq_feet and Quality improves the model really well. Interaction term between Style and Year does not really improve the model 

##adding interaction 
```{r}
model.f=(lm(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot + 
    Sq_feet:Quality))
yhat=fitted(model.f)
e=yhat-Price

```
Residual vs Fit.
```{r}
plot(yhat, e, xlab = 'Fitted Value', ylab = 'Residuals', main = 'Residuals vs Fitted Value')
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)

qqnorm(e)
qqline(e)
```
Residuals vs fit and qq plot suggests that we need to transform the Y. 

```{r}
bc=boxcox(model.f,lambda=seq(-1,1))
lambda=bc$x[which.max(bc$y)]
lambda
```
lambda is -.31313131
```{r}
p1=Price^(lambda)
mod.finalupdated=lm(p1 ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot + 
    Sq_feet:Quality)
s=summary(mod.finalupdated)
s$adj.r.squared
yhat=fitted(mod.finalupdated)
e=yhat-Price

plot(yhat, e, xlab = 'Fitted Value', ylab = 'Residuals', main = 'Residuals vs Fitted Value')
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)

qqnorm(e)
